# Task 1: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

This repository contains the solution to **Task 1** of the AI & ML Internship program â€” focusing on cleaning and preprocessing raw data for machine learning.

##  Objective
To prepare a raw dataset for machine learning by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and removing outliers.

## Dataset Used
[Titanic Dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset)

##  Key Concepts Covered
- Missing Value Handling (mean/median/mode)
- Label Encoding and One-Hot Encoding
- Standardization using `StandardScaler`
- Outlier Detection with Boxplots and IQR
- Data Visualization using Seaborn

##  Tools and Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

##  Results
The cleaned dataset is now ready for training machine learning models. Outliers in `Fare` were removed, and all missing values were imputed. Categorical variables were properly encoded, and numerical values were standardized.
